Notes (what the above indicates):
    The cost has direct relation with the depth of the tree, which means smaller depth causes lower 
cost, while larger depth causes higher cost.
    In addition, random order has the lowest cost in general, whereas ascending order has the highest
cost for all insertion medthods.
    Finally, we can notice that AVL tree has the best performance among all insertion medthods, as it
has the lowest cost and depth for all ascending order, prefix order and random order.
